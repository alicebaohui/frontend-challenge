# The frontend challenge

Our Front-end coding challenge is relatively simple and quite open ended, which
we hope will inspire creative solutions that go above and beyond the somewhat
abstract problem we propose. These are the problem's requisites:

* You must create a 50px by 50px div that moves in a linear trajectory within a
  webpage and exhibits the behavior of bouncing off any wall it touches.
* When this div receives a click event, it must clone itself, and the clone
  must possess all the properties of the original div. Additionally, you could
  make the div "mutate" when clicked. The properties you chose to "mutate"
  should come from your own creativity!
* Include any additional features that make sense to you. Surprise us.

These are our caveats:

* You can't use canvas or webGL.
* You can't use any libraries.
* You can't employ the use of IBM's Watson supercomputer.
